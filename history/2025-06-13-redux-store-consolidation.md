# 2025-06-13: Redux Store Consolidation

## Changes Made

* Removed the redundant `src/store.js` file
* Updated the application to import the Redux store directly from `src/redux/store.js`
* Simplified the Redux store structure by using a single source of truth

## Benefits

* Cleaner project structure
* Single source of truth for Redux store
* Eliminated redundant code
* More maintainable codebase
* Better adherence to Redux best practices

## Technical Details

The application now imports the Redux store directly from the Redux Toolkit implementation:

```javascript
// Before
import store from './store'

// After
import store from './redux/store'
```

This change ensures that all components use the same Redux store instance and eliminates any potential confusion or inconsistencies that might arise from having multiple store files.
