# 2025-06-13: Redux Toolkit Integration

## Changes Made

* Integrated Redux Toolkit into the project
* Created a new directory structure under `src/redux/`
* Implemented a `userInterfaceSlice` to manage UI state:
  * sidebarShow
  * asideShow
  * theme
* Updated components to use the new Redux Toolkit actions and selectors:
  * AppSidebar
  * AppHeader
  * AppAside
  * App

## Benefits

* Better state management with Redux Toolkit's modern features
* Simplified action creators with `createSlice`
* Immutable updates using Immer library (built into Redux Toolkit)
* Better organized codebase with modular slices
* Easier debugging and maintainability
* Better type safety

## Next Steps

* Update remaining components to use the Redux Toolkit implementation
* Consider adding more slices for other state domains
* Add state persistence with Redux Persist if needed
* Implement additional features using Redux Toolkit Query for API calls
